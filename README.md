# Image Editor using Neural Networks

A desktop application that predicts an item from a user sketch and suggests pictures of that item. Those pictures can be edited further and combined to make a more elaborate picture that can be exported in different formats. 

The application is implemented using Python and the neural network used is implemented from scratch without using libraries such as TensorFlow or Keras.
